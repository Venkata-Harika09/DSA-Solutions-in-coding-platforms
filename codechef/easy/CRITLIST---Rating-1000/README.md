## Problem

### Critical points in a Linked List

Given the head of a linked list, Find the number of critical points. (The starting and end are not considered critical points).

Local minima or maxima are called critical points.

A Node is called a local minima if both next and previous elements are greater than the current element.

A Node is called a local maxima if both next and previous elements are smaller than the current element.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq$ Number of elements in the linked list, $N$ $\leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq Node.data \leq 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
8
1 2 3 3 3 5 1 3

```

```
2 
```

### Explanation:

1 is a minima and 5 is a maxima hence there are 2 critical points

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
7
1 2 3 2 1 3 2 
```

```
3
```

### Explanation:

3rd node, 5th node and 6th node are the critical nodes, hence the answer is 3

```java
// Node is defined as:
// class Node{
//     int val;
//     Node next;
//     Node(int x){
//     	val = x; next = null;
//     }
// }
class Solution{
    static int solve(Node root){
                int count = 0;

        Node prev = root;
        Node curr = root.next;
        Node next = curr.next;

        while (next != null) {

            // Local maximum
            if (curr.val > prev.val && curr.val > next.val) {
                count++;
            }

            // Local minimum
            else if (curr.val < prev.val && curr.val < next.val) {
                count++;
            }

            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
            next = next.next;
        }

        return count;

    }
}
```
